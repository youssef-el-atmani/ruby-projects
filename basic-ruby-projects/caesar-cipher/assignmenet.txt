Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string:

  > caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
  => "Bmfy f xywnsl!"

You will need to remember how to convert a string into a number.
Don’t forget to wrap from z to a.
Don’t forget to keep the same case.
