# ruby-projects
This repository will hold the projects of the TOP-Ruby-Projects

Each related set of projects will be compressed in a unique directory that will have a name as the section-name of the TOP-Ruby-Course where those projects belong:
  - as an Example: the projects of `Object Oriented Programming Basics` will be kept in a directory that has the same name: `Object Oriented Programming Basics`
    - Those names may change in the future, so this naming only reflect the current TOP-Ruby-Course architecture: `november 2024`
